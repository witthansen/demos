<h1>The HTML</h1>
<h2>The <code>no-js</code> class</h2>
<p>Allows you to more easily explicitly add custom styles when JavaScript is
disabled (<code>no-js</code>) or enabled (<code>js</code>). More here: <a href="http://paulirish.com/2009/avoiding-the-fouc-v3/">Avoiding the
FOUC</a>.</p>
<h2>The order of meta tags, and <code>&lt;title&gt;</code></h2>
<p>As recommended by <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/complete/semantics.html#charset">the HTML5
spec</a>
(4.2.5.5 Specifying the document&#39;s character encoding), add your charset
declaration early (before any ASCII art ;) to avoid a potential
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/doctype-mirror/wiki/ArticleUtf7">encoding-related security
issue</a> in IE. It
should come in the first <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/semantics.html#charset">1024
bytes</a>.</p>
<p>The charset should also come before the <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> tag, due to <a href="http://code.google.com/p/doctype-mirror/wiki/ArticleUtf7">potential XSS
vectors</a>.</p>
<p>The meta tag for compatibility mode <a href="http://h5bp.com/f" title="Defining Document Compatibility - MSDN">needs to be before all elements except
title and meta</a>.</p>
<h2>X-UA-Compatible</h2>
<p>This makes sure the latest version of IE is used in versions of IE that contain
multiple rendering engines. Even if a site visitor is using IE8 or IE9, it&#39;s
possible that they&#39;re not using the latest rendering engine their browser
contains. To fix this, use:</p>
<p>```html</p>
<p><meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
```</p>
<p>The <code>meta</code> tag tells the IE rendering engine it should use the latest, or edge,
version of the IE rendering environment.</p>
<p>This <code>meta</code> tag ensures that anyone browsing your site in IE is treated to the
best possible user experience that their browser can offer.</p>
<p>This line breaks validation. To avoid this edge case issue it is recommended
that you <strong>remove this line and use the <code>.htaccess</code></strong> (or other server config)
to send these headers instead. You also might want to read <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/html5boilerplate/browse_thread/thread/6d1b6b152aca8ed2">Validating:
X-UA-Compatible</a>.</p>
<p>If you are serving your site on a non-standard port, you will need to set this
header on the server-side. This is because the IE preference option &#39;Display
intranet sites in Compatibility View&#39; is checked by default.</p>
<h2>Mobile viewport</h2>
<p>There are a few different options that you can use with the <a href="https://docs.google.com/present/view?id=dkx3qtm_22dxsrgcf4" title="Viewport and
Media Queries - The Complete Idiot&#39;s Guide"><code>viewport</code> meta
tag</a>. You can find out more in <a href="http://j.mp/mobileviewport">the
Apple developer docs</a>. HTML5 Boilerplate comes with
a simple setup that strikes a good balance for general use cases.</p>
<p>```html</p>
<p><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
```</p>
<h2>Favicons and Touch Icon</h2>
<p>The shortcut icons should be put in the root directory of your site. HTML5
Boilerplate comes with a default set of icons (include favicon and one Apple
Touch Icon) that you can use as a baseline to create your own.</p>
<p>Please refer to the more detailed description in the <a href="extend.md">Extend section</a>
of these docs.</p>
<h2>Modernizr</h2>
<p>HTML5 Boilerplate uses a custom build of Modernizr.</p>
<p><a href="http://modernizr.com">Modernizr</a> is a JavaScript library which adds classes to
the <code>html</code> element based on the results of feature test and which ensures that
all browsers can make use of HTML5 elements (as it includes the HTML5 Shiv).
This allows you to target parts of your CSS and JavaScript based on the
features supported by a browser.</p>
<p>In general, in order to keep page load times to a minimum, it&#39;s best to call
any JavaScript at the end of the page because if a script is slow to load
from an external server it may cause the whole page to hang. That said, the
Modernizr script <em>needs</em> to run <em>before</em> the browser begins rendering the page,
so that browsers lacking support for some of the new HTML5 elements are able to
handle them properly. Therefore the Modernizr script is the only JavaScript
file synchronously loaded at the top of the document.</p>
<h2>The content area</h2>
<p>The central part of the boilerplate template is pretty much empty. This is
intentional, in order to make the boilerplate suitable for both web page and
web app development.</p>
<h3>BrowseHappy Prompt</h3>
<p>The main content area of the boilerplate includes a prompt to install an up to
date browser for users of IE 6/7. If you intended to support IE 6/7, then you
should remove the snippet of code.</p>
<h3>Google CDN for jQuery</h3>
<p>The Google CDN version of the jQuery JavaScript library is referenced towards
the bottom of the page using a protocol-independent path (read more about this
in the <a href="faq.md">FAQ</a>). A local fallback of jQuery is included for rare instances
when the CDN version might not be available, and to facilitate offline
development.</p>
<p>Regardless of which JavaScript library you choose to use, it is well worth the
time and effort to look up and reference the Google CDN (Content Delivery
Network) version. Your users may already have this version cached in their
browsers, and Google&#39;s CDN is likely to deliver the asset faster than your
server.</p>
<h3>Google Analytics Tracking Code</h3>
<p>Finally, an optimized version of the latest Google Analytics tracking code is
included. Google recommends that this script be placed at the top of the page.
Factors to consider: if you place this script at the top of the page, you’ll be
able to count users who don’t fully load the page, and you’ll incur the max
number of simultaneous connections of the browser.</p>
